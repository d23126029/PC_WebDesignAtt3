        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Tara Mines is located near Navan, County Meath, Ireland. It is the largest zinc mine in Europe and among the largest globally.</p>
        <p>Discovered in 1970 by Brian Byrne and Derek Michael Romer, the mine began production in 1977. Boliden, a Swedish mining company, acquired it in 2004.</p>
        <p>The orebody lies at depths of 50–1,000 meters and is part of the Navan carbonate-hosted lead-zinc deposit.</p>
        <p>The mine produces approximately 2–2.6 million tonnes of ore annually, yielding 200,000 tonnes of zinc concentrate and 40,000 tonnes of lead concentrate.</p>
        <p>Since operations began, over 85 million tonnes of ore have been mined.</p>
        <p>Ore is crushed underground, transported to the surface, and processed in a mill upgraded in 2009 with an Autogenous Grinding mill for improved efficiency.</p>
        <p>Concentrates are transported by rail to Dublin Port and shipped to smelters in Finland, Norway, and other parts of Europe.</p>
        <p>The mine employs approximately 405 people and has implemented productivity-enhancing investments to improve cost efficiency.</p>
        <p>In 2016, the mine introduced a roller brake tester for underground vehicle safety checks, a rare innovation in mining.</p>
        <p>Operations were suspended from 2001–2003 and in 2023 due to low zinc prices and high energy costs. Production is expected to resume in mid-2024.</p>
        <p>The Tara Deep project is a potential expansion of Boliden Tara Mines that involves exploring and developing a new mineral resource located southeast of the main orebody. Discovered in 2012 through exploration drilling, Tara Deep is estimated to contain 10.2 million tonnes of inferred resources with good zinc and lead grades. Development efforts include an access drift to support intensified exploration. However, further planning, licensing, and regulatory approvals are needed for full-scale development.</p>
